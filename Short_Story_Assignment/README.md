# 🎨 LLMs Meet Multimodal Generation and Editing: A Survey

## 📚 Overview
A comprehensive survey exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionize multimodal content generation and editing across multiple domains - images, videos, 3D content, and audio. This paper provides systematic insights into the intersection of LLMs with generative AI technologies.

## ⭐ Key Highlights
- First systematic review of LLMs in multimodal generation and editing
- Comprehensive coverage of multiple modalities:
  - 🖼️ Images
  - 🎥 Videos  
  - 🎮 3D Models
  - 🔊 Audio
- Analysis of pre-LLM vs post-LLM generative techniques
- Discussion on AI safety and future directions

## 🔍 Technical Areas
- Text-to-Image Generation & Editing
- Text-to-Video Generation & Editing  
- Text-to-3D Generation & Editing
- Text-to-Audio Generation & Editing
- Multimodal Generative Agents
- Generative AI Safety

## 📝 Brief Summary
The paper examines how LLMs transform multimodal content generation by serving as:
- Evaluator
- Layout Planner
- Semantic Guide
- Backbone Architecture
- Instruction Processor

## 💡 Key Concepts
