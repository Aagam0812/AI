# 🌐 Part C: Multimodal Capabilities of LLMs

## 📝 Task Overview

In this part of the assignment, I explored the powerful capabilities of the Claude language model within an interactive Colab notebook environment. My goal was to demonstrate how Claude can be leveraged across a variety of tasks, ranging from image transcription to code generation. The notebook is structured into different sections, each focusing on a specific use case, showcasing the versatility of Claude in processing and analyzing different types of data.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
- **Transcribe Text from Image**: I utilized Claude to transcribe handwritten or printed text from images, highlighting the model's ability to process visual information.
- **Reading Slide Decks**: I converted PDF slide decks into images and used Claude to analyze and extract relevant information from them.
- **Interacting with Web Content**: I fetched web pages and had Claude generate concise summaries or extract specific details from the content.
- **Language Translation**: I used Claude's language understanding capabilities to translate text between different languages.
- **Code Generation**: I generated Python code snippets, including functions and scripts, based on natural language prompts using Claude.
- **Image Analysis**: I analyzed images to extract information, such as calculating areas or identifying objects within the image.
- **Handling Multiple Images**: I processed multiple images simultaneously, extracting key details from each one.
- **Audio Interaction**: I combined Wav2Vec2 with Claude to transcribe and analyze audio files, demonstrating natural language processing in action.
- **Using Tools**: I implemented tools that interact with code artifacts, such as saving, loading, and listing files, and used Claude to manage these tasks.
- **Make SQL Queries**: I generated SQL queries from natural language questions and executed them against a sample database.

### 📚 Artifacts Included

- **Colab Notebook**: The notebook includes all the sections mentioned above, each with detailed demonstrations of Claude's capabilities.
- **Demo Video**: [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B1_0iqxbRLowUj7P82iRPe7iDnsumPwO/view?usp=sharing)

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I Used

- **Claude**: The primary AI model used for all tasks, demonstrating its versatility and power in handling multimodal inputs.
- **Google Colab**: The platform where I implemented and ran all the demonstrations, providing an interactive and reproducible environment.
- **Wav2Vec2**: Used in conjunction with Claude for transcribing and analyzing audio files.
- **Various Python Libraries**: Including those for image processing, web scraping, and PDF handling, to support the multimodal tasks.


🌟 **Thank you for exploring Claude’s multimodal capabilities with me!** I hope this demonstration inspires you to experiment with these technologies in your own work.
