# 🎮 Part B: Claude Dev - End-to-End 2D Game Development

## 📝 Task Overview

For this part of the assignment, I embarked on a journey to develop an end-to-end 2D game using Python and the Pygame library only using claude dev. The objective was to create a fully functional game from start to finish, focusing on gameplay mechanics, user interface (UI), visual design, and sound. My goal was to not only build a game but also to ensure that it was polished, engaging, and intuitive for players.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
- **Game Concept and Objective**: I designed a simple yet engaging game where players have a clear objective, such as collecting items, avoiding obstacles, or reaching a specific goal.
- **Main Menu**: I created a visually appealing main menu with options like Start Game, Instructions, and Settings, ensuring it matched the game’s theme.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: The core gameplay mechanics were implemented, including player movement, object interaction, and collision detection, with intuitive controls.
- **Scoring and Feedback**: I added a scoring system that rewards players for achieving objectives, along with visual and audio feedback to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Game Over and Restart**: I defined clear game-over conditions and included features like a ‘Game Over’ screen with options to restart the game or return to the main menu.
- **User Interface (UI) and Visual Design**: The game’s UI was designed to be user-friendly, with consistent styling, color schemes, and integration into the game’s theme.
- **Sound Design**: I incorporated sound effects and background music that align with the game’s actions and theme, providing an immersive experience.

### 📚 Artifacts Included

- **Source Code**: The complete Python code for the 2D game, organized into clear, modular components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Demo Video**: [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W0qfPDNzXcMo5wrH57rY60RNl7pkkuHU/view?usp=sharing)

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I Used

- **Python & Pygame**: For developing the 2D game, focusing on creating a complete, end-to-end experience.
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet Extension**: I used this to enhance certain aspects of the game development process, particularly in refining gameplay mechanics and UI design.
- **Visual and Sound Design Tools**: Various tools were used to create and integrate the visual and sound elements of the game.

🎉 **Thank you for exploring my game project!** I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed developing it.
