## ðŸ’¡ **Project Overview**

This project consists of two primary tasks:

1. **NanoGPT Implementation**:
   - Recreate the **NanoGPT** model from scratch using **PyTorch**. ðŸ’»
   - Modular code inspired by the original [NanoGPT Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMLa53HDuA-i7ZBmqV7ZnA3c_fvtXnx-?usp=sharing#scrollTo=EDarxEWIRMKq) and debugging techniques.
   - Train the model on a **custom dataset**.

2. **Textbooks Are All You Need**:
   - Implement the "Textbooks Are All You Need" case study using your own dataset ðŸ“–.
