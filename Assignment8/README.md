# üöÄ End-to-End LLM Ops GenAI Application Showcase

Welcome to this **End-to-End LLM Ops** project! In this repository, we will guide you through building a **production-ready Generative AI application** that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Our goal is to demonstrate how to seamlessly integrate model development, deployment, and monitoring into a cohesive workflow.

## üåê About

This project is inspired by [An End-to-End Framework for Production-Ready LLM Systems](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/an-end-to-end-framework-for-production-ready-llm-systems-by-building-your-llm-twin/) and leverages best practices from various resources:

- [LLM Twin Course](https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course)
- [Azure SLM Innovator Lab Examples](https://azure.github.io/slm-innovator-lab/3_llmops-aistudio/README.html)
- [End-to-End Generative AI Projects](https://github.com/GURPREETKAURJETHRA/END-TO-END-GENERATIVE-AI-PROJECTS)
- [GenAIExamples by OPEA Project](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples)

By following these guidelines and principles, we‚Äôll learn how to:

1. **Develop** LLM-based models using modern frameworks.
2. **Deploy** these models into production environments with robust CI/CD workflows.
3. **Monitor and Maintain** them with observability and governance, ensuring your system remains stable and reliable.
