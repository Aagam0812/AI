## üß† Prompt Engineering Techniques

### In-Context Learning (ICL)

ICL involves providing examples within the prompt to guide the model's responses. This technique helps the model understand the desired output format and style.

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

CoT prompting encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer, enhancing its problem-solving capabilities.

### Iterative Chain-of-Thought (iCoT)

iCoT involves iteratively refining the model's responses through multiple reasoning steps, allowing for corrections and improvements.

### Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

ToT prompting enables models to explore multiple reasoning paths, enhancing decision-making and solution accuracy.

### Graph-of-Thought (GoT)

GoT involves mapping out complex relationships and dependencies between concepts, aiding in understanding multifaceted problems.

### Action-Oriented Thought (AOT)

AOT focuses on prompting the model to suggest actionable steps or solutions to a given problem.

### ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)

The ReAct pattern combines reasoning and acting by allowing the model to reason through a problem and then take action based on that reasoning.

### Forest of Thoughts

This technique involves exploring a multitude of potential solutions or ideas, akin to a 'forest' of thoughts, to enhance creativity and problem-solving.

## üóÇÔ∏è Prompt Templates

The repository includes 21 diverse prompt templates, each accompanied by practical examples demonstrating both success and failure cases. These templates are designed to provide clear guidance on effective prompt construction.

## üåê Diverse Field Prompts

We have developed three useful and diverse prompts for each of the following 10 fields:

1. Human Resources
2. Teaching
3. Finance
4. Healthcare
5. Marketing
6. Legal
7. Technology
8. Customer Service
9. Journalism
10. Entertainment

Each prompt is accompanied by test cases to validate its effectiveness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementing OpenAI Examples for PaLM 2 API

The Colab notebook demonstrates the implementation of OpenAI's example prompts tailored for the PaLM 2 API, showcasing practical applications and adaptations.

## üîß Function Calls API Example
